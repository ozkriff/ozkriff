- Born in 1990, preferred pronouns: he or they,
  human languages: English and Russian.
- 10+ years of professional experience in software development,
  including working on [CLion]&[IntelliJ-Rust][ijrust] at [JetBrains]
  and [World of Warships][wow] at [Wargaming].
- I used to be an active member of the Rust community since ~2014.
  I hope to get back to all this eventually but sadly
  all my Rust community activities [are on pause for now][pause]:
  - I used to coordinate/edit the Rust GameDev WG's [monthly newsletter].
  - I used to maintain [arewegameyet.rs].
  - I used to run the @rust_gamedev feeds [on Twitter][rust-gamedev-twi]
    and [Mastodon][rust-gamedev-mas].
  - I [used](https://t.me/s/ozkriff_games/47) to moderate
    the [Russian-speaking Rust community].
  - I made a couple of rusty turn-based hobby games like [Zemeroth]
    and [Zone of Control][zoc].
